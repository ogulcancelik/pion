# Pion Architecture

## Overview

Pion is a small chat-native agent runtime built on pi's agent/session stack.

Current shape:

```text
Telegram ─▶ Router ─▶ Debounce / Commands ─▶ Runner (pi agent session)
                           │                      │
                           │                      ├─▶ session JSONL (source of truth)
                           │                      ├─▶ runtime event logs
                           │                      └─▶ monitor snapshot
                           └─▶ Telegram live status sink
```

Main responsibilities:

- **Telegram provider** normalizes inbound Telegram updates into Pion messages
- **Router** maps each message to an agent and context key
- **Daemon control flow** handles commands, debouncing, steering, superseding, and recovery
- **Runner** owns the pi agent session for each context, loads prompt resources, and injects native tools
- **Runtime event bus** records both daemon-level and pi SDK events
- **Pi resource loader** discovers default packages, user skills, and extensions from the Pion data directory

Pion is currently **Telegram-only**. The provider interface is richer than the current surface, but only Telegram is implemented today.

## Runtime Data Layout

```text
~/.pion/
├── config.yaml
├── auth.json
├── runtime-events/
│   └── <context>.jsonl
├── sessions/
│   ├── <context>.jsonl
│   └── archive/
├── skills/
│   └── <skill>/SKILL.md
├── extensions/
├── agent-profiles.json
├── cron/
└── agents/
    └── <agent>/
        ├── SOUL.md
        ├── IDENTITY.md
        ├── AGENTS.md
        ├── USER.md
        ├── MEMORY.md
        ├── memory/*.md
        └── stickers.yaml
```

Two important boundaries:

- **Session JSONL files are authoritative conversation history**
- **Runtime event JSONL files are operational telemetry**

## Prompt Resources

Pion builds the base system prompt from the agent workspace in a stable order:

1. `SOUL.md`
2. `IDENTITY.md`
3. `AGENTS.md`
4. `USER.md`
5. `MEMORY.md`
6. `memory/*.md` (sorted by filename)
7. `memory/daily/*.md` (sorted by filename)
8. inline `systemPrompt` from config

Default packages and selected skills are loaded separately through pi's resource loader.

That gives Pion a simple split:
- **workspace files** = long-lived prompt context
- **skills/extensions/packages** = reusable capabilities discovered from `~/.pion`
- **session history** = conversation state in JSONL

## Workspace vs Execution CWD

Each agent can set both:

- `workspace` — where prompt resources live (`SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, stickers)
- `cwd` — where tools and commands execute

If `cwd` is unset, Pion falls back to `workspace`, then `process.cwd()`.

This keeps prompt authoring separate from the actual filesystem/project the agent works in.

## Session Storage

Each routed context gets its own pi-compatible session file:

- `telegram:contact:123` → `sessions/telegram-contact-123.jsonl`
- `telegram:chat:-1001234567890` → `sessions/telegram-chat--1001234567890.jsonl`

The file format matches pi's session JSONL format, so the monitor can read it directly and session replay stays simple.

Archived sessions from `/new` and `/compact` move into `sessions/archive/`.

## Runtime Event Bus

Pion records two event families:

- **Pion runtime events** — message received, buffered, merged, processing start/complete, superseded, warning emitted, output sent
- **Pi session events** — tool execution start/end, message updates, and other SDK-level activity emitted by the underlying agent session

Every context also gets a runtime-event log under `runtime-events/<context>.jsonl`.

That log is separate from session history on purpose:
- session JSONL is the user/assistant/tool conversation record
- runtime events are operational telemetry

## Resource Discovery

Pion points pi's agent directory at the Pion data directory (`~/.pion` by default). That aligns auth, skills, extensions, and installed packages under one root.

On startup, Pion best-effort installs two default packages when missing:

- `npm:@ogulcancelik/pi-session-recall`
- `npm:@ogulcancelik/pi-web-browse`

Pion then uses pi's `DefaultResourceLoader` to discover default packages, `~/.pion/skills`, and `~/.pion/extensions`. Pion supplies its own workspace-built system prompt and filters extra skills by each agent's config.

Per agent, config lists skill names:

```yaml
agents:
  main:
    skills:
      - web-browse
      - supervise
```

Those skills are loaded from `skillsDir` (default `~/.pion/skills`) and exposed through the agent session's resource loader.

The default packages remain available even when an agent has `skills: []`; that list controls extra local skill selection.

## Provider Tools

Telegram-specific tools are injected per run:

- `send_sticker` — send a named sticker from `stickers.yaml`
- `send_file` — send a file from the local filesystem

Pion-native tools are injected alongside them:

- `remember` — append durable notes to `memory/daily/`
- `subagent` — delegate a self-contained task to a peer model
- `save_subagent` / `list_subagents` — manage reusable peer profiles

Recall tools (`session_search`, `session_query`) come from the default `pi-session-recall` package.

## Message Lifecycle

1. Telegram update becomes a normalized Pion message
2. Router picks the agent + context key
3. Commands (`/new`, `/compact`, `/stop`) bypass normal prompting
4. Non-command messages enter the debounce buffer (unless `debounceMs: 0`)
5. When flushed, messages may be merged into a single prompt
6. On the first real user turn of a new day, Pion may perform a cheap git update check for its own checkout
7. If that checkout is behind upstream, Pion injects a hidden `[SYSTEM]` note into that user turn instead of sending an operator-facing alert
8. Attachments are materialized to temp files and referenced in prompt text
9. Runner resumes or creates the pi agent session
10. Output streams back to Telegram while runtime events are recorded
11. Session JSONL and runtime monitor state are updated

## Run Control Semantics

Pion is built for chat behavior rather than one-shot CLI turns:

- **debounce** batches rapid-fire fragments into one user turn
- **steering** injects new user text into an active run when the underlying pi session is streaming
- **superseding** cancels/suppresses older runs when new messages arrive or `/stop` is issued
- **compaction** summarizes the conversation and primes a fresh session

## Attachment Pipeline

Inbound Telegram media is normalized, then materialized to temp files under `/tmp/pion-media/<context>/`.

Prompt text gets explicit attachment markers like:

```text
[User attached image: /tmp/pion-media/.../photo.jpg]
```

That keeps the runtime simple:
- the agent can inspect actual files if needed
- attachment references remain visible in session/runtime artifacts

## Current Non-Goals

These are intentionally not part of Pion right now:

- alternate provider backends beyond Telegram
- a separate web UI/control plane
- replacing JSONL sessions with a database-native conversation store
- a large autonomous memory platform beyond workspace files + session recall + skills/extensions
